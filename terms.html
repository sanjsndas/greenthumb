                    <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
                    <p>All services require payment unless otherwise agreed in writing. We accept various payment methods which will be specified during checkout.

                    <p>For scheduled services, cancellations must be made at least 48 hours in advance to avoid charges.

                    <p>We strive for 100% customer satisfaction with all our services. If you're not completely satisfied, please notify us within 24 hours of service completion for us to make reasonable efforts to correct the issue.

                    <h3>8. Property Damage</h3>
                    <p>While we take utmost care, landscaping activities carry inherent risks of property damage. We carry liability insurance and will repair or compensate for accidental damage caused directly by our employees during service. Pre-existing conditions or damage not promptly reported may not be covered. Damage caused by pre-existing conditions, hidden obstacles, or acts beyond our control are not our responsibility. Prompt notification of any damage is required.</p>

                    <p>Plants installed by GreenThumb Gardens carry a 90-day guarantee against defects in materials and workmanship. We will replace plants that fail due to these reasons at no additional cost. This guarantee does not cover plants affected by extreme weather, pests, diseases, improper watering, or other factors beyond our control. Specific guarantee terms will accompany plant installation contracts. Proof of purchase and proper care documentation may be required.</p>

                    <h3>10. Weather Conditions</h3>
                    <p>Landscaping services may be delayed or rescheduled due to inclement weather at our discretion for safety and quality reasons. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of weather-related changes. Services affected by weather will be rescheduled at the earliest available opportunity. Some services like irrigation winterization are weather-dependent and must be scheduled accordingly. No refunds will be given for weather-related delays beyond our control.</p>

                    <p>While we strive to maintain uninterrupted service, occasional interruptions may occur due to maintenance, upgrades, emergencies, or circumstances beyond our control. We will make reasonable efforts to minimize service interruptions and notify clients of significant scheduled outages. We are not liable for any consequences resulting from such interruptions. Emergency service requests will be prioritized according to severity and existing commitments.</p>

These services are governed by separate agreements between you and the service provider. GreenThumb Gardens acts only as a referral agent and is not responsible for third-party work quality or outcomes.

                    <h3>19. Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>Before filing any legal action, parties agree to attempt informal resolution through good faith negotiations.

                    <p>If any provision of these terms is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining terms remain in full force and effect.
