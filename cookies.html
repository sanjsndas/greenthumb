                    <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device as you browse the web. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to site owners. Cookies allow websites to remember your preferences, login details, and other information to improve your user experience. They can be either session cookies (deleted when you close your browser) or persistent cookies (remain until they expire or you delete them). Cookies don't typically contain personal information but may track how you use a site. Modern web browsers allow you to control cookie settings through their privacy options.</p>

                    <h3>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                    <p>We use several types of cookies on our website: Strictly Necessary cookies essential for site functionality, Performance cookies that collect anonymous data about site usage, Functionality cookies that remember your preferences, and Targeting/Advertising cookies that deliver relevant content. Each type serves a specific purpose to enhance your experience. We classify cookies as first-party (set by us) or third-party (set by services we use). Our cookie declaration provides detailed information about each cookie's purpose, duration, and provider. You can manage your cookie preferences through our consent tool.</p>

                    <p>Cookies help us provide you with a better website experience by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas. They allow us to understand how visitors interact with our site so we can improve performance and content. Cookies remember your preferences to personalize your experience and make the site more relevant to you. They help our marketing efforts by measuring the effectiveness of campaigns and delivering targeted content. Without cookies, some website features may not function properly. We never use cookies to collect sensitive personal information without your consent.</p>

                    <h3>4. Managing Cookie Preferences</h3>
                    <p>You can control and manage cookies in various ways through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to view, delete, and block cookies from specific sites. However, disabling cookies may affect website functionality and your user experience. Our cookie consent banner allows you to accept or reject different cookie categories. You can change your preferences at any time by clicking the "Cookie Settings" link in our footer. We provide clear information about each cookie category to help you make informed choices. For comprehensive guidance, consult your browser's help documentation on cookie management.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>5. Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Essential cookies are strictly necessary for our website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. These cookies don't store personally identifiable information but are required for features like shopping carts or secure login. Without these cookies, services you've asked for cannot be provided. We don't require consent for essential cookies under most privacy regulations. Examples include cookies that maintain your session during navigation or balance load on our servers. These cookies are typically deleted when you close your browser.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>6. Performance Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting anonymous information. This data includes pages visited, time spent on site, and error messages encountered. We use this information to improve how our website works and measure the effectiveness of our content. These cookies don't collect information that identifies visitors personally. The data is aggregated and therefore anonymous. Examples include Google Analytics cookies that help us analyze site traffic patterns. You can opt out of performance cookies without affecting site functionality.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>7. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Functionality cookies allow our website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may remember your username, language preference, or region to save you time on subsequent visits. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts, and other customizable elements. The information collected is anonymized and doesn't track your browsing activity on other websites. While not strictly necessary, they significantly improve your browsing experience. You can block these cookies but some site features may not work as intended.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>8. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Targeting cookies are used to deliver ads more relevant to you and your interests. They remember that you've visited our website and may share this information with other organizations such as advertisers. These cookies are also used to limit how many times you see an ad and help measure advertising campaign effectiveness. While we use these cookies responsibly, you may prefer to disable them if you're concerned about privacy. These cookies are typically placed by third-party advertising networks with our permission. You can manage these cookies through our consent tool or your browser settings.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>9. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We use some third-party services that may set their own cookies to provide features like social media integration, videos, or analytics. These cookies are controlled by the respective third parties and subject to their privacy policies. Examples include cookies from Facebook, YouTube, or Google Maps. We carefully select third-party providers who respect user privacy and comply with data protection laws. However, we can't control how these third parties use cookies once they're set. We provide information about all third-party cookies in our cookie declaration for transparency.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>10. Cookie Duration</h3>
                    <p>Cookies have varying lifespans depending on their purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain for a set period (from days to years). We set reasonable expiration periods based on each cookie's function. Essential cookies typically have shorter durations, while analytics cookies may persist longer to track trends. You can see the exact duration of each cookie in our detailed cookie list. Even persistent cookies can be manually deleted through your browser settings at any time. We regularly review cookie durations to ensure they're appropriate for their purpose.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>11. GDPR Compliance</h3>
                    <p>Our cookie practices comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. We provide clear information about cookie usage and obtain consent for non-essential cookies. Our cookie consent mechanism allows granular control over different cookie categories. We maintain records of consent and make it easy to withdraw consent at any time. Data collected through cookies is processed according to our Privacy Policy. We've implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data collected via cookies. EU residents have additional rights regarding their data as outlined in our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>12. CCPA Compliance</h3>
                    <p>For California residents, our cookie practices align with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We disclose our data collection practices, including cookie usage, in our Privacy Policy. California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information, which may include certain cookie data. We don't knowingly sell personal information of minors under 16 without authorization. Our "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link provides an opt-out mechanism. We verify consumer requests to prevent fraudulent access to personal information. All CCPA rights can be exercised through our designated request channels.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>13. Cookie Consent Mechanism</h3>
                    <p>Our cookie consent solution meets regulatory requirements by providing clear, granular choices. The initial banner appears on first visit, explaining cookie usage with options to accept, customize, or reject non-essential cookies. Users can revisit their choices anytime through the "Cookie Settings" link. We don't use non-essential cookies until consent is given. The system records consent preferences to honor them on subsequent visits. We regularly audit our consent mechanism to ensure compliance with evolving regulations. The interface is designed to be accessible and easy to understand for all users.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>14. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                    <p>While you can disable cookies through browser settings, this may affect website functionality. Essential features like login, shopping carts, and security systems require cookies to work properly. Disabling cookies may prevent access to certain areas of our site or cause features to malfunction. Personalized content and preferences won't be saved between visits. Some third-party integrations may not work as intended. We recommend keeping essential cookies enabled for optimal experience while customizing other categories according to your preferences. Our site will still be accessible with basic functionality if you choose to disable cookies.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>15. Cookie Security</h3>
                    <p>We implement security measures to protect cookies from unauthorized access or tampering. Secure cookies are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections to prevent interception. HttpOnly and SameSite attributes protect against certain types of attacks. We regularly review cookie security as part of our overall cybersecurity strategy. Session cookies contain random identifiers rather than personal data. While we take precautions, users should also practice good security habits like keeping browsers updated and avoiding public computers for sensitive activities. Report any security concerns to our Data Protection Officer immediately.</p>

                    <p>We may update this Cookie Policy periodically to reflect changes in technology, legislation, or our services. Significant changes will be communicated through prominent notices on our website. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when the policy was last revised. We encourage users to review this policy regularly to stay informed. Continued use of our website after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. Historical versions of the policy are archived and available upon request. For material changes affecting user rights, we may seek renewed consent where required by law.</p>

                <div class="cookies-point">
                    <h3>17. Cookie Audits</h3 <p>We conduct regular audits of our cookie usage to ensure compliance with applicable laws and best practices. These audits assess the types of cookies in use, their purposes, and their durations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our cookie consent mechanism and user preferences. Any discrepancies or areas for improvement identified during audits are addressed promptly. Our commitment to transparency means we keep detailed records of our cookie audits and their outcomes. Users can request information about our audit processes and findings. Continuous improvement is a key aspect of our cookie management strategy.</p>
